# Business-Game
User friendly, user interactice monopoly game. It is a CLI only, suggested layout for best vision of terminal in ubuntu is: enter fullscreen mode and zoom out till you get the board perfectly

To Play this game, change directory to Monopoly and run 'make all' in the linux terminal which would generate two executable files: businessgame and dicegenerator and run the businessgame executable using ./businessgame which would start the game and also opens a new terminal where the dice generator is running and generates a random number from 2-12.
